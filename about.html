    hello, i'm aisha kazembe. it is great to see you here. i am an engineer and artist.
     i currently attend parsons as a masters student in design and technology, after graduating from 
     the university of southern california with a b.s. in environmental engineering, class of 
     2022. my work focuses on digital and physical communication, sustainability, and fabrication 
     with a particular interest in memory and experiences, and how these concepts interact with 
     digital and physical environments. i enjoy working with digital systems, code, modeling, and
    fabrication, and have prior work experience in
     digital system design and environmental data transformation, management, and analysis.
    these interests amalgamate as i pursue a career in collaborative efforts to create built and 
    digital environments that interact harmonically with humans, the physical world, and 
    the eye.</p>
