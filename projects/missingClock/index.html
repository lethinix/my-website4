    <p>the missing click is a clock made using p5js that quantifies and displays
      missing someone through time. the clock uses several variables related to
      the time the user has known another person, time spent with them, and time away
      to create a visual that represents how time passes as a function of distance 
      from another person. on this clock, time moves forward when the two people are away,
      and backward when they are together.
